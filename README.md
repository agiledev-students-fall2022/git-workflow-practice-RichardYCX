I think that this article takes a more idealistic view of software engineering that most others would in the field. Yes, perhaps software engineering, in its execution, should really be boring with the excitement being able to work with new technology and creating solutions to existing problems. Syntactically speaking, it should be easy. But this is rarely the case, ever, for very good reasons that even the author alludes to, such as non-technical teams shrining deadlines or hurrying developers. Software is never developed in isolation and changes to the original plan will often require teams to pivot and scramble to implement new features. Additionally, compliance to this policy is an issue. Different software developers will perform differently based on the project or even technology that they are working on. How can you then guarantee that absolutely no mistakes will be made? Software is often riddled with bugs that developers will fix retroactively, defeating the purpose of "boring" software development. While the article itself is quite interesting, it seems to present an ideal rather than a practical viewpoint on modern software development.
